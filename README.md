# StaminaInfo

Quantify each status as a number within their respective bars (at their center).

Note: This mod uses bar width to calculate (instead of pulling from character data).

- Works for:
  - Stamina Bar
  - Extra Stamina Bar
  - Affliction Bars

- Configurable:
  - Font Size
  - Outline Width

The number will be cut off or removed if its bar is not the minimum width (15f).
